\brief Analog-to-digital converter (adc)

\note ADC clock frequency has its upper limit that is related to the Periheral
Bus A (PBA) clock. Thus care has to be taken to choose the proper prescaler for
the PBA during the ADC initialization. For UC3A0/A1, consult the ADC
charasteristics table from the datasheet page 772 for maximum ADC clock.
