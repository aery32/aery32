Aery32 library
==============

This folder contains the library of Aery32 Software Framework for AVR32 microcontrollers. Source files are placed directly here under the root directory. Header files (.h and .hh) are located at the ``aery32/`` subdirectory.  The linker scripts can found from the ``ldscripts/`` directory.

To compile the library just call

    make

When done, an ``libaery32_{mpart}.a`` archive file has been created, where {mpart} is the name of the defined MCU part. The default MCU part value is uc3a1128. To change this, use the environment variable after the make command

    make MPART="uc3b1256"

If you have a standalone project, where you want to use Aery32 library, copy the created .a archive under your project root. Also copy the ``aery32/`` directory that includes the header files.

---

Other make targets are

    make clean

that removes the compiled .o, .d and .a files from this root directory.

    make re

recompiles the library and

    make qa

recompiles the library with additional warning options. If you have [Doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/) installed, you may like to build a local version of the API documentation. This can be done by just running Doxygen

    doxygen
