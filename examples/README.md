Aery32 comes with plenty of example programs, which work out of box. Every example program consists from a single file located here under the `examples/` directory.

To quickly test an example code, copy it over the current `main.c` and program the board

    cd myproject
    cp examples/toggle_led.cpp main.cpp
    make programs
