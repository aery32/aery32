Aery32 Framework comes with plenty of example programs, which work out of box. Every example program consists from a single file located here under the `examples/` directory.

To quickly test an example code copy it over the current `src/main.c` and program the board

    cd myaery32-project
    cp examples/toggle_led.c src/main.c
    make programs

The detailed description of the specific example program can be found from the Aery32 Reference Guide.
